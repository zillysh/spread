          While designers’ cultural ambitions seem to be always on the rise,
          what we often get is yet another form of a-critical graphic design.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few uppercase words, centred or ranged at the top-left corner of a
          page, set in the regular weight of any grotesque font. More often than
          not, it’s black type on white, or the reverse, but colours may appear.
          Be it an international design exhibition, a show for the Venice
          Biennale, a new artist-run space or the output of a design school, in
          recent years our western “art-design” bubble is flooded with similar
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was vainly waiting for this trend to slowly fade out, like any
          other tag on Trend List (which doesn’t list this one), I realised I
          needed a name to define it and to explain the annoyance I felt about
          it.

          <p>
            Over time I recognised a similar annoyance when randomly listening
            to music on the radio, and realised there is an audio equivalent to
            this typographic sameness: it’s Auto-Tune. Auto-Tune was originally
            developed as a tool to automatically correct vocal tracks in order
            to make them sound perfectly in tune, by removing accidental
            deviations from the melody; as we all know by now, it has turned
            into the standard voice treatment for a great amount of contemporary
            pop music productions, and is widespread to the point of being
            almost impossible to avoid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, this default, CAPS-LOCK typographic treatment is largely
            present in our visual landscape. It can be applied to almost
            anything, and makes this anything instantly look OK, fit for our
            times (at least from a designer’s perspective). This is AUTO-TUNE
            TYPOGRAPHY.

          In 1995, on Emigre#34, Mr Keedy wrote a piece titled
          <a
            href="https://www.emigre.com/assets/file/pdfMagazine/Emigre34Zombie.pdf"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Zombie Modernism. It Lives!</a
          >, claiming that “modernism is no longer a style, it’s an ideology,
          and that ideology is conservatism.” What I’m observing in recent years
          is not a new personification of that conservative take on modernism:
          this one is apparently devoid of any ideology, and goes even further
          in renouncing to visually and typographically articulate a thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          To articulate refers to the ability to express a thought while
          preserving its nuances and complexity. The verb is also etymologically
          connected to our articulations, the joints in our body which allow us
          to move with elasticity and to adapt our range of action to the needs
          of each situation. If this sensation relates to your experience,
          imagine then your knees and elbows are blocked: the range of your
          movements is reduced, the ease of action disappears, your possibility
          to react is limited. This all-caps, no-contrast typography has a
          similar limiting effect on communication: it moves inflexibly in the
          world, it evens its contents out and ends up only communicating
          itself. But what does it exactly stand for?
        </p>
        <p>
          AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY could be considered as one of the many
          manifestations of
          <a href="https://khole.net/issues/youth-mode/" target="_blank"
            >“normcore”</a
          >or “post-authentic” graphic design, two labels currently used to
          identify reactions to previous visual trends seeking an idyllic
          “authenticity”; both labels relate to the concept of
          <a
            href="https://linedandunlined.com/archive/default-systems-in-graphic-design/"
            target="_blank"
          ></a
          >, which has been discussed for almost twenty years now.

      <section class="a4">
        <p>
          The abundance of quotation marks shows my distance from this debate.
          In this struggle to establish who’s more “authentic” or “sincere”, I
          prefer taking another perspective: one that acknowledges the existence
          of conventions, cultural norms, standards, templates, styles, tested
          solutions, and the fact that designers can rely on them in their work,
          but doesn’t give up the idea that a project requires the time to be
          considered before being quickly boxed into an existing shape. When
          using and re-using graphic formulae, we could at least try to be aware
          of their origin and meaning (if any), and of the reasons why we’re
          using them.
        </p>
        <p>
          While collecting examples to illustrate this article, I noticed two
          attitudes towards this TYPOGRAPHY: to some designers it’s the default
          setting, while others consider it as one of many available options,
          which can be chosen when trying to position a project within a given
          niche or subculture.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, quite paradoxically, this typographic monoculture seems to
          thrive in European independent art publishing and events, and in
          schools with cultural ambitions; the paradox lies in seeing its
          extreme conformism and disregard to visual diversity used to support
          and promote alternative content, often self produced and loaded with
          critical expectations which are instantly denied by its flattened-out
          visual presentation.

        <p>
          If Auto-Tune’s effectiveness lies in removing errors or in minimizing
          a singer’s peculiar vocal timbre, AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY works because
          it transforms words into undifferentiated blocks that can be placed on
          a page without worrying too much: text becomes an unproblematic
          material. AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY turns visual design into an automatic,
          a-critical activity, and gives up what I believe is still essential to
          this practice: taking responsibility for what things look like.
